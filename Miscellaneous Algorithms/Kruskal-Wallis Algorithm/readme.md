### Kruskal-Wallis Test Algorithm in C

The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between the medians of three or more independent groups. It is an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test and is particularly useful when the assumptions of ANOVA (normality and homogeneity of variance) are not met.

#### Steps of the Kruskal-Wallis Test

1. **Rank all the data:** Combine all the groups' data into one dataset and rank the values. If there are ties, assign the average rank to the tied values.

2. **Calculate the rank sums:** For each group, sum the ranks of the observations.

3. **Compute the test statistic (H):** The Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is calculated using the formula:

      H=N(N+1)12​∑nj​Rj2​​−3(N+1)

   where:
   - \( N \) = total number of observations across all groups
   - \( R_j \) = sum of ranks for group \( j \)
   - \( n_j \) = number of observations in group \( j \)

4. **Determine the p-value:** Compare the test statistic \( H \) to the chi-squared distribution with \( k - 1 \) degrees of freedom (where \( k \) is the number of groups).

5. **Decision:** If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis, indicating that at least one group median is different from the others.

### Importance of the Kruskal-Wallis Test

1. **Non-Parametric Nature:** It does not assume a normal distribution of the data, making it applicable in various real-world scenarios where data may not meet ANOVA assumptions.

2. **Robustness:** The Kruskal-Wallis test is robust against outliers and non-homogeneity of variance, which are common issues in practical data analysis.

3. **Multiple Groups Comparison:** It allows for the comparison of three or more groups simultaneously, saving time and resources compared to multiple pairwise tests.

4. **Broad Applications:** It is widely used in various fields, including biology, psychology, and social sciences, for analyzing experimental and observational data.

5. **Foundation for Further Analysis:** If the Kruskal-Wallis test indicates significant differences, post-hoc tests (like Dunn’s test) can be conducted to identify specific group differences.
